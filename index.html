                <h3>Future Web Dev Superstar: Expert in Turning Simple Tasks into Complex Bugs.</h3>
                <p>I’m wading into web development—not out of a burning passion for code, but because new dresses and cute accessories aren’t going to buy themselves. I’m also on a mission to kick my reel-watching habit, so why not swap scrolling for coding? Who knew that unraveling bugs could be the key to unlocking my future wardrobe? Just wait—once I master this, I’ll be styling while debugging!</p>
